Based on the provided context and instructions, here are some CUE queries to help analyze the codebase:

### Query 1: Validate Service Dependencies
```cue
// Query to validate that all declared dependencies in services are defined within the same file.
service: {
    for k, v in _ {
        // Ensure each dependency is a defined service
        for dep in v.dependencies {
            dep in _ // Check if dependency exists in the service map
        }
    }
}
```
*Purpose: Ensures that all dependencies listed for each service are actually defined within the same file, preventing undefined references.*

### Query 2: Check for Required Fields in Resources
```cue
// Query to ensure all resources have required fields: type, name, and infrastructure.
resource: {
    for k, v in _ {
        type: string
        name: string
        infrastructure: {
            vpc: string
            subnet: string
            securityGroups: [...string]
        }
    }
}
```
*Purpose: Validates that each resource has the necessary fields to be properly configured.*

### Query 3: Identify Security Group Usage
```cue
// Query to find all resources using a specific security group.
resource: {
    for k, v in _ {
        if "sg-frontend" in v.infrastructure.securityGroups {
            [k]: v
        }
    }
}
```
*Purpose: Identifies all resources that are associated with the "sg-frontend" security group, useful for security audits.*

### Query 4: Validate Environment Variables
```cue
// Query to validate the format of environment variables in services.
service: {
    for k, v in _ {
        env: {
            if "API_KEY" in v.env {
                API_KEY: string & =~"^[A-Za-z0-9]{32}$" // Ensure API_KEY matches expected pattern
            }
            if "LOG_LEVEL" in v.env {
                LOG_LEVEL: "info" | "debug" | "error" // Ensure LOG_LEVEL is one of the allowed values
            }
        }
    }
}
```
*Purpose: Ensures that environment variables conform to expected formats and values, enhancing configuration reliability.*

### Query 5: Detect Potential Security Issues
```cue
// Query to detect services with open egress rules to the internet.
service: {
    for k, v in _ {
        for egress in v.egress {
            if egress.to == "0.0.0.0/0" {
                [k]: v // Flag services with unrestricted egress
            }
        }
    }
}
```
*Purpose: Identifies services that have egress rules allowing traffic to any IP address, which could pose a security risk.*

These queries are designed to help developers understand the structure and configuration of their codebase, ensuring compliance with best practices and identifying potential issues.
